There is a **lot** of telemetry data. Reducing, removing and standardising the telemetry data that you ingest will save cost, increase signal to noise ratio and help make your Observability platform a cleaner, more useful place.

This hands on Observability Lab will demonstrate various tips and tricks on how to achieve a clean, standardised telemetry ingest using when you send data via the Dynatrace Collector](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/ingest-from/opentelemetry/collector){target=_blank} (this is a fully supported version of the open source upstream collector).
